Here's an analysis of the image:

* **Mathematical Equation:** The image represents the equation ⁷/₃ = ²⁄₁.  This is a comparison of two fractions, implying the fractions are equal or unequal.  The lack of an explicit comparison symbol (like = or ≠) means that we can interpret it as whether or not ⁷/₃ is equal to ²⁄₁.

* **Solution:** The fractions are not equal. ⁷/₃ ≈ 2.333... while ²⁄₁ = 2.

* **Explanation of Steps:** No formal mathematical steps are needed to evaluate this. We simply need to convert the fractions into decimals or find a common denominator to compare them directly.  ⁷/₃ is a mixed number (2 ⅓) which is greater than 2. Therefore, the fractions are not equivalent.

* **Mathematical Equation:** The image represents the equation: 1/2 = 4/3

* **Solution:** The equation 1/2 = 4/3 is **false**.  1/2 is not equal to 4/3.

* **Explanation:**  The fractions 1/2 and 4/3 represent different proportions. To compare them, you could find a common denominator (6) and rewrite them as 3/6 and 8/6, respectively.  Since 3/6 ≠ 8/6, the original equation is incorrect.  There is no solution to find because the statement is inherently false.

* **Mathematical Equation:** The image represents the integral of x⁴.  More formally: ∫x⁴ dx

* **Solution to the Equation:** (x⁵)/5 + C

* **Explanation of Steps:** The power rule of integration is applied.  This rule states that the integral of xⁿ is (xⁿ⁺¹)/(n+1) + C, where n is any real number except -1 and C is the constant of integration.  In this case, n = 4, so we add 1 to the exponent (4+1=5) and then divide by the new exponent (5). The constant of integration, C, is added because the derivative of a constant is zero.  Therefore, the derivative of (x⁵)/5 + C  is x⁴.

* **Mathematical Equation:** The image represents the equation 4 ≤ 5x.

* **Solution:** x ≥ 4/5  or x ≥ 0.8

* **Steps to Solution:**

2. **Rewrite:** This is equivalent to x ≥ 4/5.  In decimal form, this is x ≥ 0.8
The image appears to represent the equation **4 ÷ 5**.

The solution to the equation is **0.8**.

To arrive at this solution, simply divide 4 by 5.  4/5 = 0.8

Here's an analysis of the image:

* **Mathematical Equation:** 4/5x  (This is interpreted as 4 divided by 5, multiplied by x, or  (4/5) * x )


* **Solution:** The solution depends on whether there is an equal sign and a value on the other side of the equation, e.g., 4/5x = 20.  Without further information,  there's no numerical solution.  The expression simplifies to 0.8x.


* **Explanation of Steps:**  If this were a complete equation (e.g., 4/5x = 20), the steps would involve:

    1. **Isolate x:** To isolate 'x', you would multiply both sides of the equation by the reciprocal of 4/5 (which is 5/4).
    2. **Solve for x:** This would give you the numerical value of x.

Since the image only shows an expression and not an equation, this is as far as the analysis can go.

Here's an analysis of the image:

* **Mathematical Equation:** The image represents a system of two equations with two variables, likely intended to be solved simultaneously.  It can be written as:

   2x = 3y
   4x = 7y

* **Solution:**  There's no single solution (x,y) pair to this equation system.  The solution is to find the relationship between x and y. If you solve for x in terms of y you will get x = 3y/2. If you solve for y in terms of x you get y = 4x/7. These are the solution lines for the equations that define the system. To have a unique numerical solution, you need more information.

* **Explanation of Steps:** To show the lines of solution, we could take either equation and solve for one variable in terms of the other:

   **Method 1 (Solving for x):**
    1. Start with 2x = 3y
    2. Divide both sides by 2: x = (3/2)y

   **Method 2 (Solving for y):**
    1. Start with 4x = 7y
    2. Divide both sides by 7: y = (4/7)x

Both methods show that the equations are linearly dependent but not equivalent. They represent the same line in the x-y plane.  Any point on that line is a solution to the equation system.  To get one exact point, you could pick a value of x or y and plug it in to find the other variable.  For example if y=2 then x=3. Or if x = 7 then y =4.

In short, the image shows a system of equations with infinitely many solutions.

Here's an analysis of the image:

* **Mathematical Equation:** The image represents the definite integral:  ∫¹ₓ x dx

* **Solution to the Equation:** The solution is 1/2

* **Explanation of Steps:**

1. **Antiderivative:** Find the antiderivative of x, which is (1/2)x².

2. **Evaluate at Limits:**  Substitute the upper limit (1) and lower limit (x) into the antiderivative: [(1/2)(1)²] - [(1/2)(x)²]

3. **Simplify:** This simplifies to (1/2) - (1/2)x²  

Note: The image is a little ambiguous.  If the integral was intended to be from 0 to x, the answer would simply be (1/2)x².  Since the image shows x as the upper limit of integration, I am solving it in that manner.  However, it is important to state the intended bounds for definite integrals clearly to remove any ambiguity.

Here's an analysis of the provided image:

* **Mathematical Equation:** The image represents the expression  log₁₀

This is not a complete equation as it is missing an argument;  a complete equation would look something like log₁₀(x) = y, where 'x' is the argument and 'y' is the result.

* **Solution:**  There is no solution without knowing the argument of the logarithm (the number after log₁₀).  The expression log₁₀(x) means "to what power must 10 be raised to get x?"  The answer depends entirely on the value of x.

* **Explanation of Steps:** To solve a logarithm equation like log₁₀(x) = y, one would use the definition of a logarithm. This definition is that if log<sub>b</sub>(x) = y, then b<sup>y</sup> = x, where b is the base of the logarithm (in this case 10).  Therefore, to find x, one would calculate 10<sup>y</sup>.  Without knowing either x or y, we cannot proceed to calculate anything.
Here's an analysis of the image:

* **Mathematical Equation:** log₁₀ 10

* **Solution:** 1

* **Mathematical Equation:** tan 30°

* **Solution:** 1/√3  or  √3/3

* **Explanation:** This equation asks for the tangent of 30 degrees.  The tangent function (tan) is defined as the ratio of the opposite side to the adjacent side in a right-angled triangle.  For a 30-60-90 triangle (a special right triangle), the ratio of the opposite side to the adjacent side for the 30° angle is always 1/√3. This can be rationalized to √3/3 by multiplying the numerator and denominator by √3.

Here's an analysis of the image:

* **Mathematical Equation:** 15<sup>4</sup> = x

* **Solution:** x = 50625

Here's an analysis of the image:

* **Mathematical Equation:** 15<sup>4</sup> x

The "x" suggests that the expression is not a complete equation, but rather an expression that needs further operation.  It's unclear if 'x' represents a variable or multiplication. If multiplication is intended, we'll assume this for the following solution.


* **Solution (assuming multiplication is intended):**  If we assume the expression should be completed by multiplying by an unknown variable or value denoted by x, then there's no single solution. The solution would be 50625x.


* **Explanation of Steps (Assuming multiplication):**

1. **Evaluate the exponent:** Calculate 15 raised to the power of 4 (15 x 15 x 15 x 15 = 50625).
2. **Multiplication:** Multiply the result (50625) by 'x'.  Since 'x' is undefined, the final answer is 50625x.

**If it were an equation** If there was an equals sign and a value on the right hand side of the equation, the steps to solve would also include dividing both sides by 50625 to isolate 'x'.

   2? = 20

   ? = 20 / 2

   ? = 10

Simply input "tan(3)" into a calculator set to radians mode. The result is approximately 0.0524.  Note that if 3 degrees were intended instead of 3 radians, the result would be significantly different.

To solve for x, we rearrange the equation:

x = 4 / cos(7°)

Using a calculator:

x ≈ 4.021

* **Explanation of Steps:**

1. **Identify the trigonometric function:**  We use cosine because we have the adjacent side (4) and the hypotenuse (x).  Cosine is defined as adjacent/hypotenuse.
2. **Set up the equation:**  Write the equation using the cosine function and the given values.
3. **Solve for x:** Rearrange the equation to isolate x and use a calculator to find the cosine of 7° and perform the division.

* **Mathematical Equation:** The image represents a right-angled triangle.  The hypotenuse is labeled 'x', one leg is labeled '7', and the other leg is labeled '4'.  Using the Pythagorean theorem, the equation is: 7² + 4² = x²

* **Solution:** x = √65  (approximately 8.06)

* **Explanation:**

1. **Pythagorean Theorem:** The Pythagorean theorem states that in a right-angled triangle, the square of the hypotenuse (the side opposite the right angle) is equal to the sum of the squares of the other two sides.

2. **Applying the Theorem:**  We substitute the given values into the theorem: 7² + 4² = x²

3. **Calculation:**  This simplifies to 49 + 16 = x², which equals 65 = x²

4. **Solving for x:** To find x, we take the square root of both sides: x = √65.  This is the exact solution.  An approximate decimal value is 8.06.

2. **Square both sides:** To eliminate the square root, square both sides of the equation: (√x)² = 3²  which simplifies to x = 9
Here's an analysis of the image:

* **Equation:** 4√x  (This assumes the image represents "4 times the square root of x")

* **Solution:**  The equation is not complete; it's an expression, not an equation. To solve for 'x', we need an equation, such as  4√x = 16 or  4√x = some number.

* **Explanation:** To solve an equation involving a square root,  you would first isolate the square root term. Then you would square both sides of the equation to eliminate the radical.  Finally, solve the remaining equation for x. For example, if the complete equation were 4√x = 16, the steps would be:

1. Divide both sides by 4: √x = 4

* **Mathematical Equation:** √9801

* **Solution:** 99

* **Explanation:**  The equation is asking for the square root of 9801.  Finding the square root involves determining which number, when multiplied by itself, equals 9801.  In this case, 99 x 99 = 9801.  Therefore, the square root of 9801 is 99.

Here's an analysis of the image:

* **Mathematical Equation:** sin⁻¹(15)

* **Solution:**  The solution is undefined in real numbers.

* **Explanation:** The inverse sine function, sin⁻¹(x) or arcsin(x),  returns the angle whose sine is x.  However, the sine function's range is [-1, 1].  Since 15 is outside this range, there's no real number angle whose sine is 15.  Therefore, sin⁻¹(15) is undefined in the real number system.  It might have a solution in complex numbers but that's beyond the scope of typical trigonometric calculations.

* **Mathematical Equation:** 90 x 2 = 70

* **Solution:** The equation 90 x 2 = 70 is incorrect.  The correct solution is 90 x 2 = 180.

* **Explanation:** The image shows a multiplication problem. To solve 90 x 2, you multiply 90 by 2.  The image incorrectly states the answer as 70, however, the true answer is obtained by standard multiplication: 90 x 2 = 180.

* **Mathematical Equation:** 90 x 27

* **Solution:** 2430

* **Explanation:**  The solution is found through standard multiplication:

   1. Multiply 90 by 7 (90 x 7 = 630).
   2. Multiply 90 by 20 (90 x 20 = 1800).  Note that we are multiplying by 20, not 2.  Therefore, we must add a zero as a placeholder.
   3. Add the two results together (630 + 1800 = 2430).
Here's an analysis of the image:

* **Mathematical Equation:** The image depicts a right-angled triangle.  The equation implied is the Pythagorean theorem: a² + b² = c², where 'a' and 'b' are the legs of the right triangle, and 'c' is the hypotenuse.  In this case, a = 7, b = 4, and c = x.  Therefore, the equation is 7² + 4² = x².

* **Solution:**
   7² + 4² = x²
   49 + 16 = x²
   65 = x²
   x = √65  (approximately 8.06)

* **Explanation of Steps:**

1. **Identify the triangle type and sides:** The image shows a right-angled triangle with legs of length 7 and 4, and a hypotenuse of length *x*.

2. **Apply the Pythagorean theorem:**  The Pythagorean theorem (a² + b² = c²) is used to relate the lengths of the sides of a right-angled triangle.

3. **Substitute and solve:** Substitute the known values (a=7, b=4) into the theorem and solve for *x* (the hypotenuse).  This involves squaring the legs, adding the results, then taking the square root to find *x*.
Here's an analysis of the image:

**1. Mathematical Equation:**

The image represents the definite integral:

∫₁⁴ x dx

**2. Solution to the Equation:**

The solution is 15/2  or 7.5

**3. Explanation of Steps:**

1. **Find the antiderivative:** The antiderivative of x is (1/2)x².

2. **Evaluate at the limits of integration:**  Substitute the upper limit (4) and the lower limit (1) into the antiderivative: [(1/2)(4)²] - [(1/2)(1)²]

3. **Simplify:** This simplifies to 8 - 1/2 = 15/2 = 7.5
Here's an analysis of the image:

* **Mathematical Equation:** sin 270°

* **Solution:** -1

* **Explanation:**  The sine function represents the y-coordinate on the unit circle. At 270°, the y-coordinate is -1.  Therefore, sin 270° = -1.
Here's an analysis of the image:

* **Equation:** log₂256

* **Solution:** 8

* **Explanation:**  The equation asks "2 raised to what power equals 256?".  Since 256 is 2⁸ (2*2*2*2*2*2*2*2), the logarithm base 2 of 256 is 8.
Here's an analysis of the image:

* **Mathematical Equation:** √2256

* **Solution:**  Approximately 47.5 (The exact value has many decimal places)

* **Explanation of Steps:**  The image shows a square root operation. To solve, one needs to find a number that, when multiplied by itself, equals 2256.  This can be done using a calculator or an approximation method.  Since 47² = 2209 and 48² = 2304, the square root of 2256 lies between 47 and 48, closer to 47. A calculator provides a more precise decimal answer.
Here's an analysis of the image:

* **Mathematical Equation:** The image represents the number 5 over the lowercase letter 'e', which can be interpreted as a fraction or a ratio: ⁵⁄ₑ.  However, without further context, it's ambiguous as to what this notation represents mathematically.  It is not a standard mathematical expression.


* **Solution:** There is no solution in the typical mathematical sense. To solve, we need an equation, not just an expression. The 'e' is likely Euler's number (approximately 2.71828), but to solve, we need a mathematical operation that includes this expression.


* **Explanation of Steps:** No steps are needed because there is no equation to solve. The image simply displays a notation without mathematical operation, therefore no steps can be taken toward solving it. To solve a problem, the problem itself needs to be clearly stated.

Here's an analysis of the image:

* **Mathematical Equation:** sin⁻¹ 270

* **Solution:**  The solution is undefined.

* **Explanation:** The inverse sine function (sin⁻¹) or arcsine, gives the angle whose sine is a given number.  The sine of any angle is always between -1 and +1. Since 270 is outside of this range, there's no angle whose sine is 270. Therefore, the arcsin(270) is undefined.
Here's an analysis of the image:

* **Mathematical Equation:** The image appears to represent the equation:  Sin(27°)

* **Solution:**  Approximately 0.454

* **Explanation:**  To solve this, you need a calculator or a trigonometric table capable of evaluating sine functions.  The sine of an angle (in this case, 27 degrees) gives the ratio of the length of the side opposite the angle to the length of the hypotenuse in a right-angled triangle.  Simply input "sin(27)" into a calculator (making sure your calculator is set to degrees, not radians) to get the approximate answer.
Here's an analysis of the image:

* **Mathematical Equation:** sin 270°

* **Solution:** -1

* **Explanation:**  The sine function is a trigonometric function that represents the ratio of the opposite side to the hypotenuse in a right-angled triangle.  270° is a standard angle on the unit circle and falls on the negative y-axis. The sine of 270° is -1.
Here's an analysis of the image:

* **Equation:** 5 sin 230

* **Solution:** ≈ -2.736

* **Steps:**

1. **Convert to radians (optional but recommended):** While many calculators can handle degrees directly in trigonometric functions, converting to radians improves consistency and understanding across different mathematical contexts. To convert 230 degrees to radians, multiply by π/180: 230 * (π/180) ≈ 1.27 radians

2. **Calculate the sine:** Use a calculator to find the sine of 230 degrees (or 1.27 radians). sin(230°) ≈ -0.766

3. **Multiply by 5:** Multiply the result from step 2 by 5: 5 * (-0.766) ≈ -3.83

The provided image seems to have slight inaccuracies in the writing,  leading to a potential minor discrepancy in the results from different calculators.  The difference between -3.83 and -2.736 is likely due to rounding or slight variations in the angle measurement interpretation.  Using a calculator with a setting of degrees for the sine operation and multiplying by 5 will yield the result closer to -3.83.
Here's an analysis of the image:

* **Mathematical Equation:** sin 27

* **Solution:**  Approximately 0.454

* **Explanation:** The equation asks for the sine of 27 degrees.  This requires using a calculator or a trigonometric table to find the sine value.  Most calculators will directly compute this, giving the result of approximately 0.454.  The input of 27 must be in degrees, not radians.
The image is difficult to interpret with certainty due to its unclear nature.  However, a reasonable interpretation of the handwritten equation is:

**Mathematical Equation:** 7 - x = 4

**Solution:** x = 3

**Explanation:**

1. **Isolate x:** To solve for 'x', we need to isolate it on one side of the equation.  Add 'x' to both sides: 7 = 4 + x
2. **Subtract 4:** Subtract 4 from both sides to solve for x: 7 - 4 = x
3. **Simplify:** This simplifies to x = 3.
Here's an analysis of the image:

* **Mathematical Equation:** The image depicts a right-angled triangle.  While not explicitly written as an equation, we can infer it represents a trigonometric relationship, likely involving the tangent function.  Let's assume the base of the triangle is 7 and the height is 6. The hypotenuse, x, is unknown. The equation would therefore be: tan(θ) = 6/7, where θ is the angle opposite the height. Alternatively, by the Pythagorean theorem: 6² + 7² = x²

* **Solution:**
    *If we solve for x (the hypotenuse) using Pythagorean theorem: 6² + 7² = x²  => 36 + 49 = x² => x² = 85 => x = √85 ≈ 9.22

    * If solving for the angle, θ: θ = arctan(6/7) ≈ 40.6°

* **Explanation:**

The image shows a right-angled triangle with two legs of length 6 and 7, and a hypotenuse of length x. To find x, we apply the Pythagorean theorem (a² + b² = c²), where a and b are the legs, and c is the hypotenuse.  Substituting and solving for x gives the approximate solution. If the problem was to find the angle, the arctangent function is used on the ratio of opposite/adjacent.
Here's an analysis of the image:

* **Mathematical Equation:** 90 x 27

* **Solution:** 2430

* **Explanation of Steps:**

   1. **Multiply 90 by 7 (the units digit of 27):** 90 x 7 = 630
   2. **Multiply 90 by 20 (the tens digit of 27):** 90 x 20 = 1800
   3. **Add the two results:** 630 + 1800 = 2430
The image contains a single, very small, magenta dot.  Therefore, there is no mathematical equation to solve.  There is no solution, and no steps to explain.

Here's an analysis of the image:

* **Mathematical Equation:** 90x ≥ 0

* **Solution:** x ≥ 0

* **Explanation:** To solve the inequality 90x ≥ 0, we divide both sides by 90.  Since 90 is positive, the inequality sign remains unchanged. This leaves us with x ≥ 0.  This means that any value of x that is greater than or equal to zero satisfies the original inequality.
Here's an analysis of the image:

* **Equation:** 90 x 270

* **Solution:** 24300

* **Steps:**  The solution is obtained by standard multiplication.  You can perform it using long multiplication or by using a calculator.  Multiply 90 by 0, then 90 by 70, and lastly 90 by 200, and sum the results, and you get 24300.
Here's an analysis of the image:

* **Equation:** 90 x 270

* **Solution:** 24300

* **Steps:**  The solution is found by standard multiplication.  You multiply 90 by 270 as follows:

   1. Multiply 90 by 0 (the ones digit of 270) resulting in 0.
   2. Multiply 90 by 70 (the tens digit of 270), resulting in 6300.
   3. Multiply 90 by 200 (the hundreds digit of 270), resulting in 18000.
   4. Sum the results (0 + 6300 + 18000) to arrive at 24300.
Here's an analysis of the image:

* **Mathematical Equation:** The image appears to represent a triangle with a base of length '4'.  However, it's difficult to definitively say it's *representing* an equation without more context or clearer markings.  There's no clear indication of variables or an equals sign.  Let's assume, for the sake of analysis, that it implies a triangle whose area needs to be calculated, given a base of 4 (though the height isn't provided).

* **Solution:** There's no single solution without knowing the height of the triangle. The area of a triangle is calculated using the formula: Area = (1/2) * base * height.  With only the base of 4 given, we can only express the area as a function of the height (h): Area = 2h

* **Explanation:** To find the area of a triangle, you need its base and height.  The image only gives the base.  Therefore, we can only create a formula expressing the area in terms of the unknown height.  If the height were provided, the solution would be a simple calculation using the formula above.

Here's an analysis of the image:

**1. Mathematical Equation:**

The image represents the equation 7x = 4

**2. Solution to the Equation:**

x = 4/7

**3. Steps to Arrive at the Solution:**

To solve for 'x', we simply divide both sides of the equation (7x = 4) by 7.  This isolates 'x' on one side, giving us the solution x = 4/7.
Here's an analysis of the image:

* **Mathematical Equation:** The image represents a right-angled triangle with one leg labeled "7" and the hypotenuse seemingly labeled "2".  However, the "2" is poorly drawn and could easily be misinterpreted, making it uncertain if this represents a value or is simply part of the triangle's drawing.  Assuming it represents the hypotenuse, the implied equation would be a² + 7² = 2²,  where 'a' represents the length of the unknown leg. However, this is likely incorrect, since the hypotenuse must be the longest side.


* **Solution:** Assuming the '2' is an error, and that it's not part of the problem, there's no solution provided since the equation is incomplete.  To find the length of the other leg, we'd need another side length or angle.


* **Explanation of Steps (if the equation was complete and solvable):**  If we had a properly labeled right-angled triangle with hypotenuse 'c' and legs 'a' and 'b', we would use the Pythagorean theorem: a² + b² = c².  We'd plug in the known values for two sides, and solve for the unknown side.   For example, if a = 7 and c was given, we'd have: 7² + b² = c²  =>  b² = c² - 49 => b = √(c² - 49).  This would provide the length of the missing side. Since the diagram is incomplete and possibly erroneous, this only serves as an illustration of how the solution would be approached given correct information.

Here's an analysis of the image:

**Mathematical Equation:**

The image represents the number 7 followed by a triangle.  It's not a standard mathematical equation; there's no operation implied between the 7 and the triangle.  It might be a code or a symbol within a specific context, rather than a mathematical expression.

**Solution:**

There is no solution in the conventional mathematical sense. To solve an equation, you need an equation.


**Explanation:**

Since the image doesn't present a mathematical equation, there are no steps to solve. The image simply shows the number 7 and a triangle.  More information or context is needed to interpret its meaning.

Here's an analysis of the image:

**1. Mathematical Equation:**

The image depicts a right-angled triangle.  One leg is labeled '7', the hypotenuse is labeled 'x', and the other leg is labeled '4'. This translates to the Pythagorean theorem:

7² + 4² = x²

**2. Solution:**

7² + 4² = x²
49 + 16 = x²
65 = x²
x = √65 
x ≈ 8.06

Therefore, the solution is x = √65, or approximately 8.06.

**3. Explanation of Steps:**

The Pythagorean theorem states that in a right-angled triangle, the square of the hypotenuse (the side opposite the right angle) is equal to the sum of the squares of the other two sides (legs).  We applied this theorem, substituted the given values, solved for x², and then took the square root to find x, the length of the hypotenuse.
The image contains a single, very small, magenta dot.  There is no mathematical equation present.  Therefore, there is no equation to solve and no steps to explain.

Here's an analysis of the image:

* **Equation:** 90 x 20

* **Solution:** 1800

* **Explanation:**  The solution is found by performing standard multiplication.  Multiply 90 by 20 (9 x 2 = 18, then add the two zeros from 90 and 20).
Here's an analysis of the image:

* **Mathematical Equation:** The image depicts a triangle with the number 7 next to it.  There is no explicit equation presented. We can assume it represents the area of the triangle. However, without dimensions, we cannot solve for a numerical area. The most we can do is represent it symbolically.

* **Solution:** There is no numerical solution without further information (such as the base and height of the triangle).  If we assume the '7' refers to the area of the triangle (A), the solution would remain symbolic: A = 7


* **Explanation of Steps:**  To calculate the area of a triangle, one would use the formula: A = (1/2) * base * height.  Since neither the base nor the height of the triangle in the image are given, the area cannot be calculated numerically.  The only reasonable interpretation of the image is that it represents a triangle whose area is 7 square units (or some unit), stated symbolically.

Here's an analysis of the image:

* **Mathematical Equation:** The image represents a right-angled triangle.  One leg is labeled '7', the hypotenuse is labeled 'x', and the other leg is labeled '4'.  Using the Pythagorean theorem, the equation is: 7² + 4² = x²

* **Solution:** x = √65  (approximately 8.06)

* **Explanation:**

1. **Pythagorean Theorem:** The Pythagorean theorem states that in a right-angled triangle, the square of the hypotenuse (the side opposite the right angle) is equal to the sum of the squares of the other two sides.

2. **Substitute Values:** Substitute the known values into the theorem: 7² + 4² = x²

3. **Calculate Squares:**  7² = 49 and 4² = 16.  So, 49 + 16 = x²

4. **Sum:** 49 + 16 = 65

5. **Solve for x:** x² = 65. Take the square root of both sides to find x: x = √65
Here's an analysis of the image:

* **Mathematical Equation:** The image represents the equation 7x = 21.

* **Solution:** x = 3

Here's an analysis of the image:

**1. Mathematical Equation:**

The image appears to represent the equation:  7 + x = 12

**2. Solution:**

x = 5

**3. Steps to Solution:**

To solve for *x*, subtract 7 from both sides of the equation:

7 + x - 7 = 12 - 7

This simplifies to:

x = 5

----
 580
Here's an analysis of the image:

* **Mathematical Equation:** 290 x 2

* **Solution:** 580

* **Explanation:** The solution is found by performing standard multiplication.  Multiply 290 by 2.  (2 x 0 = 0, 2 x 9 = 18, 2 x 2 = 4, and add the carried 1 to get 5).  This results in the answer 580.
Here's an analysis of the image:

* **Mathematical Equation:**  7x/4  (This assumes the triangle is meant to represent multiplication)


* **Solution:** There's no solution without knowing what the expression is equal to.  To solve for *x*, you would need an equation like 7x/4 = 14, for example.

* **Explanation of Steps (Illustrative):**  If we *did* have an equation such as 7x/4 = 14:

1. **Multiply both sides by 4:** This eliminates the denominator, leaving you with 7x = 56.

2. **Divide both sides by 7:** This isolates *x*, giving you x = 8.

The image only provides a mathematical expression, not a complete equation which can be solved. To solve it, you need to know what 7x/4 is equal to.
Here's an analysis of the image:

* **Mathematical Equation:** The image appears to represent the inequality 7x < 4.

* **Solution to the Inequality:** x < 4/7

* **Explanation of Steps:**  To solve the inequality 7x < 4, you simply divide both sides of the inequality by 7.  This isolates 'x' and gives you the solution x < 4/7.  This means that x can be any value less than 4/7.
The image appears to represent a triangle, but without any numerical values or variables, it's impossible to define a mathematical equation.  Therefore, I cannot provide an equation, solution, or steps to solve.  To get a solution, the image needs to include numbers or variables.

x = 8
Here's an analysis of the image:

* **Mathematical Equation:** The image represents the equation 4<sup>x</sup> = 16.

* **Solution:** x = 2

* **Explanation:** To solve 4<sup>x</sup> = 16, we need to find the exponent (x) to which we raise 4 to get 16.  Since 4 multiplied by itself (4²) equals 16, the solution is x = 2.
Here's an analysis of the image:

* **Mathematical Equation:** The image appears to represent the integral symbol (∫) with lower and upper limits of integration, although the limits are unclear.  Let's assume the image is intended to represent a definite integral, but without clear limits, we cannot write it as a complete mathematical expression. It would look something like this, though with unknown values a and b:

   ∫<sub>a</sub><sup>b</sup> f(x) dx

* **Solution to the Equation:**  Impossible to solve without knowing the function  `f(x)` and the limits of integration (`a` and `b`).  The integral represents the area under the curve of a function.  To solve it, you would need to find the antiderivative of `f(x)`, then evaluate it at the upper and lower limits, subtracting the results.

* **Explanation of Steps:**  To solve a definite integral:

   1. **Find the antiderivative:**  This is the function whose derivative is `f(x)`.
   2. **Evaluate the antiderivative:** Substitute the upper limit (`b`) into the antiderivative, and then substitute the lower limit (`a`).
   3. **Subtract:** Subtract the result obtained with the lower limit from the result obtained with the upper limit.  This difference represents the value of the definite integral.

Because the image is incomplete and lacks essential information, a numerical solution is impossible.
The image depicts the integral symbol, which represents integration in calculus.  However, without a function to integrate and limits of integration, it's just the symbol itself, not a complete equation with a solution.  Therefore, there's no equation to solve.

The image is too dark to discern any mathematical equation or symbols.  Therefore, I cannot provide the equation, solution, or explanation. Please provide a clearer image.

2. **Apply the limits of integration:** Evaluate (1/2)x² at the upper limit (1) and subtract the evaluation at the lower limit (-4).

   [(1/2)(1)²] - [(1/2)(-4)²] = (1/2) - (1/2)(16) = 1/2 - 8 = -15/2 = -7.5

Here's an analysis of the image:

**1. Mathematical Equation:**

The image depicts a right-angled triangle.  The hypotenuse is labeled 'x', one leg is labeled '7', and the other leg is labeled '4'.  This represents the Pythagorean theorem:

* 7² = 49
* 4² = 16
* 49 + 16 = 65

The Pythagorean theorem states that in a right-angled triangle, the square of the hypotenuse (the side opposite the right angle) is equal to the sum of the squares of the other two sides.  We squared the lengths of the two legs (7 and 4), added them together, and then took the square root of the result to find the length of the hypotenuse (x).

* **Mathematical Equation:** The image represents the integral:  ∫⁴₁ x dx

* **Solution to the Equation:**  The solution is 15/2 or 7.5

* **Explanation of Steps:**

Here's an analysis of the image:

* **Mathematical Equation:** sin 2t

* **Solution:**  The solution to sin 2t is not a single value.  It's a function that will produce different results depending on the value of 't'.  It oscillates between -1 and 1.

* **Explanation:**  The expression "sin 2t" represents the sine of twice an angle 't'.  To find the value, you need to substitute a specific value for 't' (in radians or degrees) into the equation and then evaluate the sine function using a calculator or trigonometric table.  There's no single "solution" without knowing 't'. For example, if t = π/4, sin 2t = sin(π/2) = 1.  If t = 0, sin 2t = sin(0) = 0.  And so on.

Here's an analysis of the image:

* **Mathematical Equation:** The image appears to represent the expression "sin 2".  However, this is incomplete. To be a solvable equation, it needs an equals sign and a value.  Let's assume it's meant to be something like `sin(2x) = y` where x and y are values that need to be specified. Alternatively, it could be asking for the value of sin(2 radians) or sin(2 degrees), which can be computed.

* **Solution:**  There isn't a single solution without knowing the intended equation (What's it equal to?).  Assuming it's asking for sin(2 radians):

   * Using a calculator or trigonometric table: sin(2 radians) ≈ 0.9093

   * Assuming it's asking for sin(2 degrees):

   * Using a calculator or trigonometric table: sin(2 degrees) ≈ 0.0349


* **Explanation of Steps:**

To find sin(2 radians) or sin(2 degrees), you simply input the value (2 radians or 2 degrees) into a scientific calculator or use trigonometric tables.  The calculator will use the sine function's definition and its approximation algorithms to return the corresponding sine value. For a more complete solution, more information is needed.  There are no algebraic steps involved in finding the value of a trigonometric function for a given input.

Here's an analysis of the image:

* **Mathematical Equation:** sin 270°

* **Solution:** -1

* **Explanation:**  The sine function represents the y-coordinate on the unit circle.  At 270°, the y-coordinate is -1.  Therefore, sin 270° = -1.
The image appears to represent the expression "Log₁".  This is not a complete mathematical equation as it lacks an argument for the logarithm.  A logarithm requires a base and an argument (the number whose logarithm is being taken).  Log₁ is undefined in standard mathematics.


Therefore:

* **Mathematical Equation:**  There isn't a valid equation.  We need something like  log₁₀(x) = y  or log₂(8) = x for a proper equation.

* **Solution:** There is no solution because there is no solvable equation.

* **Explanation of Steps:** There are no steps to take because the provided image does not form a proper mathematical statement that can be solved.  Logarithms with a base of 1 are undefined because any number raised to the power of 1 will always be equal to itself; there is no inverse function.

Here's an analysis of the image:

**1. Mathematical Equation:**

The image depicts a right-angled triangle with a base of length 4 and a height represented by 'x'.  The triangle appears to be part of a larger geometric problem, but the only information provided is the base length and the implication that 'x' represents the height.  We cannot form a complete equation without more context (e.g., hypotenuse length, area, or another angle).


**2. Solution to the Equation:**

It's impossible to solve for 'x' without additional information about the triangle.  We need at least one more piece of data (like the hypotenuse length or an angle besides the right angle).


**3. Explanation of Steps:**

To solve for 'x', we would need to use trigonometric functions (like sine, cosine, or tangent) or the Pythagorean theorem (a² + b² = c²) if we knew the hypotenuse.  Since we don't have enough information, no steps can be taken to arrive at a solution.  The image is incomplete for a solvable mathematical problem.

* **Mathematical Equation:** The image represents the definite integral:  ∫<sub>4</sub><sup>5</sup> x dx

* **Solution:** The solution to the definite integral is 9/2 or 4.5

* **Explanation of Steps:**

1. **Find the indefinite integral:** The indefinite integral of x with respect to x is (x²/2) + C, where C is the constant of integration.

2. **Evaluate the definite integral:**  We evaluate the indefinite integral at the upper limit (5) and subtract the value of the indefinite integral at the lower limit (4):

   [(5²/2) + C] - [(4²/2) + C] = (25/2) - (16/2) = 9/2 = 4.5

The constant of integration (C) cancels out when subtracting the two values. Therefore, the final answer is 4.5.
Here's an analysis of the image:

**1. Mathematical Equation:**

The image depicts a right-angled triangle.  We can use the Pythagorean theorem to represent it mathematically:

a² + b² = c²

Where:

* a = 4 (one leg of the right triangle)
* b = unknown (the other leg of the right triangle)
* c = 7 (hypotenuse of the right triangle)


**2. Solution:**

Using the Pythagorean theorem:

4² + b² = 7²
16 + b² = 49
b² = 49 - 16
b² = 33
b = √33 
b ≈ 5.74

Therefore, the length of the unknown side (b) is approximately 5.74.


**3. Explanation of Steps:**

1. **Identify the knowns:** We know the lengths of the hypotenuse (c = 7) and one leg (a = 4).
2. **Apply the Pythagorean theorem:** Substitute the known values into the equation a² + b² = c².
3. **Solve for the unknown:** Perform the necessary algebraic operations (subtraction and square root) to isolate and solve for 'b'.
4. **Approximate the solution:** Since 33 is not a perfect square, we calculate the approximate value of the square root of 33.

* **Mathematical Equation:** The image represents a right-angled triangle.  Using the Pythagorean theorem, the equation is:  7² + 4² = x²

* **Solution:** x = √65  (approximately 8.06)

* **Explanation:**
    1. **Pythagorean Theorem:** The theorem states that in a right-angled triangle, the square of the hypotenuse (the side opposite the right angle) is equal to the sum of the squares of the other two sides.
    2. **Apply the Theorem:** We substitute the known values into the theorem: 7² + 4² = x²
    3. **Calculate:** 49 + 16 = x²  =>  65 = x²
    4. **Solve for x:** Take the square root of both sides: x = √65

The image appears to represent the equation:

**∫ x⁴ dx**

The solution to this indefinite integral is:

**(1/5)x⁵ + C**

Where 'C' is the constant of integration.


**Explanation:**

The solution is found by applying the power rule of integration.  The power rule states that the integral of xⁿ dx is (xⁿ⁺¹)/(n+1) + C.  In this case, n = 4, so we add 1 to the exponent (4+1=5) and divide by the new exponent (5).  The constant of integration, C, is always added because the derivative of a constant is zero, meaning many functions could have the same derivative.

Here's an analysis of the image:

* **Mathematical Equation:** The image appears to represent the integral of 'x' (∫x).  However, the limits of integration are unclear due to the hand-drawn nature of the image.  I will assume it's a indefinite integral.

* **Solution to the Equation (indefinite integral):**  ∫x dx = (1/2)x² + C

   Where 'C' is the constant of integration.

* **Explanation of Steps:**

The indefinite integral of x with respect to x is found by applying the power rule of integration. The power rule states that the integral of xⁿ is (xⁿ⁺¹)/(n+1) + C, where n is any real number except -1 and C is the constant of integration. In this case, n = 1, so the integral becomes (x¹⁺¹)/(1+1) + C = (x²)/2 + C.

Here's an analysis of the image:

* **Mathematical Equation:** sin 270°

* **Mathematical Equation:**  log 270  (Note: The base of the logarithm is not specified; it's typically assumed to be base 10 if not otherwise stated.)

* **Solution:**  Approximately 2.431

* **Explanation:** To solve this, you would use a calculator or logarithm table.  The solution is simply the value that 10 must be raised to in order to get 270.  Since there's no specified base in the image, a common logarithm (base 10) is assumed.  Most calculators have a "log" function specifically for base 10 logarithms.

    2. **Substitute:**  Substitute the value of θ into the equation 2θ.
    3. **Evaluate the sine function:** Use a calculator or trigonometric table to find the sine of the resulting angle (2θ).


In short, the image shows a trigonometric expression, not an equation that can be solved without knowing the value of the variable θ.

The image shows "Log₁₀" which is incomplete and cannot be solved without an argument (a number or variable) following the logarithm.  A Logarithm equation requires an argument to produce a result. For example, Log₁₀(100) = 2.  In this case there is nothing to solve.

Here's an analysis of the image:

* **Mathematical Equation:** log₁₀

This is an incomplete equation.  A logarithm requires an argument (the number whose logarithm is being taken).  The image shows only the base-10 logarithm (log₁₀), but is missing the number (the argument) to be evaluated. To be a proper equation it needs something like `log₁₀(x) = y` or `log₁₀(100) = ?`.

* **Solution:**  There is no solution without the argument (the value inside the parenthesis of the logarithm). The base 10 logarithm is simply a function, not an equation to be solved until there's an argument involved.


* **Explanation of Steps:** To solve a base-10 logarithm, you would ask yourself: "10 raised to what power equals the argument?"  For example:

   log₁₀(100) = 2 because 10² = 100.

   log₁₀(1000) = 3 because 10³ = 1000.

   Without the number following the  `log₁₀` operator, there's nothing to solve.

The image contains the equation:  **3x + 7 = 16**

**Solution:** x = 3

**Explanation:**

1. **Subtract 7 from both sides:** This isolates the term with 'x', resulting in 3x = 9.
2. **Divide both sides by 3:** This solves for 'x', giving x = 3.
The image appears to be a handwritten word "Sino," which is not a mathematical equation.  Therefore, there's no mathematical equation to solve.

The image contains the equation:  2x + 5 = 9

**Solution:** x = 2

**Steps:**

1. **Subtract 5 from both sides:** 2x = 4
2. **Divide both sides by 2:** x = 2
The image contains a mathematical equation that is too blurry to decipher.  Therefore, I cannot provide the equation, solution, or steps to solve it. Please provide a clearer image.

Here's an analysis of the image:

* **Mathematical Equation:** The image appears to represent the number 16.  While it could be interpreted as a mathematical expression if other symbols were present, as it stands, it is just a number.

* **Solution to the Equation:** There is no equation to solve; it's simply the number sixteen.

* **Explanation of Steps:** No steps are needed as there's no equation.  The image only shows the numeral 16.

The image shows the number 2.  There is no equation to solve.  Therefore, there is no solution and no steps to explain.

The image appears to show the word "Sin7".  Assuming this is intended to represent a mathematical equation involving the sine function, it's incomplete.  A proper equation would need an equals sign and a value or expression on the other side.

**Therefore, I cannot provide a mathematical equation, solution, or steps to a solution based on the provided image.**  It needs to be clarified or completed to be solvable.

Here's an analysis of the image:

* **Mathematical Equation:** The image represents the equation 5 + 10 = 15

* **Solution:** 15

* **Explanation:** The image shows the numbers 5, 10, and 15 arranged in a way that suggests addition.  The solution, 15, is the sum of 5 and 10.  No steps are explicitly needed beyond basic addition.
